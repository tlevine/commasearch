Here's something I found with `,`. I indexed a bunch of files from New York. ::

Then I searched with this file.

    $ cat /home/tlevine/csv-files/https/data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/bmxf-3rd4.csv
    Center Name,Borough,Location,Comments
    Mainchance,Manhattan,"120 East 32nd Street
    ",Open 24 hours
    The Living Room ,Bronx,"1241 Lafayette Avenue
    ",Open 24 hours
    Olivieri Center,Manhattan,"257 West 30th Street
    ",Open from 7:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m. This program remain open 24 hours during winter months
    The Gathering Place,Brooklyn,"2402 Atlantic Avenue
    ",Open from 7:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m. This program remain open 24 hours during winter months
    Project Hospitality,Staten Island,"25 Central Avenue
    ",Open from 7:30 a.m.-8:30 p.m. This program remain open 24 hours during winter months
    $ , -v /home/tlevine/csv-files/https/data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/bmxf-3rd4.csv

I looked scrolled through the output and found this row. ::

    {"result_columns": [2], "search_columns": [0], "overlap": 1, "nrow": 131, "url": "file://home/tlevine/csv-files/https/data.cityofnewyork.us/resource/jhn3-4vdj.csv"}

`jhn3-4vdj.csv` looks like this. ::

    $ head jhn3-4vdj.csv
    Year & Quarter,Facility Name,Provider Agency,Performance Tier
    2011 Q3,126 Street Shelter,Palladia,1st Performance Tier
    2011 Q3,85 Lexington,BRC,1st Performance Tier
    2011 Q3,Create Young Adult,"Create, Inc.",1st Performance Tier
    2011 Q3,HWC Assessment,HELP USA,1st Performance Tier
    2011 Q3,Kenton,Project Renewal,1st Performance Tier
    2011 Q3,Palace Men,BRC,1st Performance Tier

    2011 Q3,Saratoga,HELP USA,1st Performance Tier
    2011 Q3,SCCW TLC,Center for Urban Community Services,1st Performance Tier

It turns out that each contains records about Project Hospitality. ::

    $ grep Project\ Hospitality bmxf-3rd4.csv jhn3-4vdj.csv 
    bmxf-3rd4.csv:Project Hospitality,Staten Island,"25 Central Avenue
    jhn3-4vdj.csv:2011 Q3,Project Hospitality,Project Hospitality,1st Performance Tier
    jhn3-4vdj.csv:2011Q4,Project Hospitality,Project Hospitality,2nd Performance Tier

Was there anything I missed? ::

    $ grep -c Project\ Hospitality *|grep -v :0$
